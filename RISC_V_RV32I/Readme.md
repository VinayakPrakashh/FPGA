# Single Instruction Execution Cycle Pipeline in Verilog for RISC-V RV32I
**This project implements a pipeline for the single instruction execution cycle of a processor using Verilog in Xilinx Vivado. It targets the RISC-V RV32I instruction set architecture (ISA).**
### RISC-V RV32I: A Detailed Overview ###
RISC-V (Reduced Instruction Set Computer - V) is an open-standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on simplified computer architecture principles. The RV32I variant is a 32-bit base integer instruction set, providing a foundation for various computing applications.
