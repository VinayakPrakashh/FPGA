# 16-bit GCD Calculator in Verilog
This project implements a 16-bit Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) calculator using Verilog Hardware Description Language. It utilizes a modular architecture with separate control path and datapath modules for efficient design and scalability.
## Features:
1. Calculates the GCD of two 16-bit unsigned integers.
2. Employs a [insert GCD algorithm name] algorithm for efficient calculation.
3. Modular design with separate control and datapath modules.
